# Session with Justin 11/11
## Laravel Library
    -   One database seeder to populate books and authors, etc.
    -   3 tables given as a requirement, but we will need more than that.
    -   Don't need seeders or factories, we can use Tinker to sumulate data.
    -   Use POST when you Create
    -   Read is GET
    -   Update is a PUT
    -   Delete is DELETE
